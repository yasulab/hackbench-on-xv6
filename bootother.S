# Start an Application Processor. This must be placed on a 4KB boundary
# somewhere in the 1st MB of conventional memory (APBOOTSTRAP). However,
# due to some shortcuts below it's restricted further to within the 1st
# 64KB. The AP starts in real-mode, with
#   CS selector set to the startup memory address/16;
#   CS base set to startup memory address;
#   CS limit set to 64KB;
#   CPL and IP set to 0.

# Bootothers (in main.c) starts each non-boot CPU in turn.
# It puts the correct %esp in start-4,
# and the place to jump to in start-8.
#
# This code is identical to bootasm.S except:
#   - it does not need to enable A20
#   - it uses the address at start-4 for the %esp
#   - it jumps to the address at start-8 instead of calling bootmain
